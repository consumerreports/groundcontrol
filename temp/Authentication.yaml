testName: Authentication
criterias:
  - criteriaName: A product has an authentication system that corresponds to the sensitivity of the user data it manages
    indicators:
      - indicator: If a product supports user accounts, it has an authentication system for accessing those accounts
        procedures:
          - Start product and note whether users are prompted to authenticate to access account data

      - indicator: If a product is packaged with an account with default credentials, those credentials are unique to the instance of the product
        procedures:
          - If the product has default credentials, make note their uniqueness, and watch out for credentials like, "default", "admin", or "12345678".

      - indicator: If a product has an authentication system, the user must authenticate each time they want to use the product
        procedures:
          - Start & stop the product multiple times, and make note of when user is prompted to authenticate.
        
      - indicator: If a product has an authentication system, it requires at least two pieces of information to authenticate users
        procedures:
          - Create an account and make note of information needed to do so *for authentication*. e.g. username + password

      - indicator: For products that handle sufficiently sensitive data, users can choose to use multi-factor authentication.
        procedures:
          - Create an account and look for settings to enable MFA.

      - indicator: For products that handle sufficiently sensitive data, users can choose to use multi-factor authentication whenever product is activated, or when a device is unreckognized.
        procedures:
          - Create an account, enable MFA, and try using product multiple times on one device to see if MFA is required each time.
          - Create an account, enable MFA, and try using product multiple times on different devices to see if MFA is required each time.

      - indicator: If the product uses a password/passphrase for authentication, it requires that passwords are at least 8 characters long
        procedures:
          - Create an account and make note minimum password lengths. Try passwords such as "a" and "a1b2c3".

      - indicator: If the product uses a password/passphrase for authentication, the password/passphrase may be at least 20 characters long
        procedures:
          - Create an account and make note maximum password lengths. Try passphrases such as "i love sufficiently long passwords".
      
      - indicator: If the product uses a password/passphrase for authentication, it requires that passwords are reasonably complex
        procedures:
          - Create an account and make note complexity limitations. Try passwords such as "aaaaaaaa" and "12345678".

      - indicator: If the product uses a password/passphrase for authentication, it allows all reasonable characters as input
        procedures:
          - Create an account and make note character restrictions. Try passwords such as ")a!aaaaa$a%" and "p 4 5 5 w 0 R d !".

      - indicator: If the product uses a password/passphrase for authentication, it is compatible with popular password managers. 
        procedures: 
          - With a password manager installed, create an account. See if password manager can be used as expected.

  - criteriaName: A product that has an authentication system resists attempts to break it
    indicators:
      - indicator: The product allows users to be notified via an out-of-band medium when account security settings are changed.
        procedures:
          - Create an account and make note of whether or not users are able to use email, SMS, or push notifications to be notified when changes occur or account credentials need to be reset.

      - indicator: To change a password/passphrase/pin, a user must enter the previous password/passphrase/pin, or have access to a secondary system that is used to reset it.
        procedures:
          - Create an account and attempt to change the password/passphrase/pin associated with it. Make note of whether or not users are required to enter old credentials, or look toward their email/phone/etc. to reset them.

      - indicator: The product notifies users when account security settings have changed.
        procedures:
          - Create an account and attempt to change various security settings, such as MFA or password, and make note of whether or not the user is notified.

      - indicator: If the product has an authentication system, it also has a system to prevent brute-force/dictionary attacks
        procedures:
          - Try to login to product using various incorrect credentials and note whether you have limited attempts to do so, or if it would take far too long to test every combination of allowed or common characters/strings/phrases.
